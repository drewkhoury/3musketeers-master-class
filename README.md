## What is 3 Musketeers?

It's a great way to create a convention that fits almost every situation.

It enables different teams to be able to work together, despite using drastically different technologies,

To do that, all they have to do is follow a minimal amount of convention.


## Things you'll learn in this master class ...

- Make
- Examples/patterns
- some basic makefile overview
- makefile patterns in 3 musketeers (target vs _target)
- when itâ€™s better to package a script in the image vs attaching it as a volume
- Should every target be runnable just as well locally as it would in <insert specific build server>?
- How important is it to try to ensure it can run on any platform? If they are using Make and Gradle, where should certain logic go?  In Gradle? in Make? depends on ????
